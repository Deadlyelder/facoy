# Running FaCoY on IJaDataset and evaluating on BigCloneBench (RQ2)

## IJaDataset
IJaDataset is a large inter-project software repository built by [SeClone project](https://sites.google.com/site/asegsecold/projects/seclone). The current version is IJaDataset-2.0 which is available at the [BigCloneBench page](https://github.com/clonebench/BigCloneBench/blob/master/README.md) otherwise we should ask [SeClone project](https://sites.google.com/site/asegsecold/projects/seclone) site administrator.

## BigCloneBench
BigCloneBench is a clone detection benchmark of known clones in the IJaDataset source repository. The current version of the benchmark, IJaDataset (with modifications), and tools for measuring clone detection recall are available at [BigCloneBench page](https://github.com/clonebench/BigCloneBench/blob/master/README.md).
