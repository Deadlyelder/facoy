# Running FaCoY on IJaDataset and evaluating on BigCloneBench (RQ2)

## Virtual Machine
We have created a virtual machine to allow researchers and developers to use FaCoY easily. Everyone can download the virtual machine [here](https://) including FaCoY and all the required software. 

We set up the credential, “dyclink” as the username and “Qwerty123” as the password, for our VM. The home directory of DyCLINK is /home/dyclink/dyclink_fse/dyclink. The credential for the database is “root” as the username and “qwerty” as the password.

## IJaDataset
IJaDataset is a large java inter-project software repository built from [SeClone project](https://sites.google.com/site/asegsecold/projects/seclone) by Ambient Software Evoluton Group. The current version is IJaDataset-2.0 which is available at the [BigCloneBench page](https://github.com/clonebench/BigCloneBench/blob/master/README.md) otherwise we should ask [SeClone project](https://sites.google.com/site/asegsecold/projects/seclone) site administrator.

## BigCloneBench
BigCloneBench is a clone detection benchmark of known true and false clones mined from the big data inter-project repository IJaDataset-2.0 (25,000 subject systems, 365MLOC).. The current version of the benchmark BigCloneBench is available at [BigCloneBench page](https://github.com/clonebench/BigCloneBench/blob/master/README.md).
