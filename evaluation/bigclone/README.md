# Running FaCoY on IJaDataset and evaluating on BigCloneBench (RQ2)

## IJaDataset
IJaDataset is a large inter-project software repository built from [SeClone project](https://sites.google.com/site/asegsecold/projects/seclone) by Ambient Software Evoluton Group. The current version is IJaDataset-2.0 which is available at the [BigCloneBench page](https://github.com/clonebench/BigCloneBench/blob/master/README.md) otherwise we should ask [SeClone project](https://sites.google.com/site/asegsecold/projects/seclone) site administrator.

## BigCloneBench
BigCloneBench is a clone detection benchmark of known true and false clones mined from the big data inter-project repository IJaDataset-2.0 (25,000 subject systems, 365MLOC)..
